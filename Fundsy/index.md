$Project Details$

Create a crowdfunding platform on NEAR Protocol where anyone can create a Crowdfund with a goal amount and a set expiry date of 1 week. If the week elapses but the Crowdfund gets up to the goal, the Crowdfund creator can withdraw the contributions but if the amount doesn't meet the goal, everyone that deposited for that crowdfund can then withdraw out the amount they put in.

#### Tech Stack:

1. **_Smart Contracts:_** The contracts will be written with Rust and deployed on the NEAR Protocol, you have to learn about it via the docs and also learn Rust too.
2. **_Server:_** The back-end should be in Go and for anyone to create a Crowdfund, they must be authenticated and authorized by the back-end, in other words, user registration. 
3. **_Client:_** The front-end should be built with TypeScript and Next.js.
4. **_Landing Page:_** Yes, there will be a landing page. Use Astro and make it pretty ðŸ˜˜.

#### Requirements:

- The project will be hosted at this URL: https://crowdfunding.adeola.io and the smart contract will be deployed at this address: crowdfund.a-deola.testnet.near.
- Do not use an external server framework for the back-end and use only the Go standard library for handling HTTP connections.
- Do not use an ORM and use SQLc where you can write raw SQL.
- Use Shadcn, MagicUI and 21st for the UI. You can generate a really pinkish palette using the theme generator too ðŸ’…, purrrr. Lol.
